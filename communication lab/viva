FM
Intermediate frequency am, fm
Why FM has better noise 
How many sidebands does FM have and what is Carson rule 
What is modulation index and its formula 
Which is used for long distance communication. Fm or AM
What parameters does bandwidth depend on
modulation index of FM depends on what all parameters
Carson's Rule 
How many sidebands does FM have
Frequency range of FM
Fm working + bandwidth+ modulation index parameters
Lossless, Infinite sideband - fm
Need for Modulation 
Modulation index
Am vs fm 

PLL
Explain working of PLL hardware 
What is VCO, use in PLL

BPSK QPSK
Basic block diagrams of BPSK , Qpsk , PLL
Signal space diagram 
Compare BPSK and QPSK - working , give theoretical eqns, Which has higher BER, which one has more bandwidth and why

PCM
What is quantisation error
Compare sampling, encoding and quantisation 
Differentiate PCM and delta modulation wrt bandwidth
Define Bit Error Rate. What is Eb/N0? What is Eb and what is N0 in that?
If 10 bits are transmitted and 5 bits have errors, what is the BER?
Effect of step size and noise in PCM
Explain SAMPLING theorem, Nyquist criteria and Shanonâ€™s theorem 
Mid tread and mid raise 
Slope overload vs granular error
Explain Companding
